Streamlined-Grading-System
==========================

Term project for CMPT 275 at Simon Fraser University

This project consist of implementing a mock grading system for some school ABC. 
There where multiple requirments for the project, and it was structured in such a way as to 
replicate a real world software engineering enviroment. 

For the entire semester ~3 Months, we were placed in groups of 8 and had to work together to accomplish 
a prototype of the proposed project. 

##Team members: 
* Patrick Wan,  phwan@sfu.ca
* XuShun Qiu,  xsq@sfu.ca
* Demet Dilekci, ddilekci@sfu.ca
* Jeremy Hartmann, jhartman@sfu.ca
* Asante Nyamekye, anyameky@sfu.ca
* Zihan Chen, czihan@sfu.ca
* Lekabari Nghana, lnghana@sfu.ca
* Kwan Yui Wong, kyw6@sfu.ca

## Process
As a team we went through all phases of software development, from: 
<ol>
<li>requirment acquisition and planning, </li>
<li>design and planning, </li>
<li>Implementation and coding, </li>
<li>Testing, </li>
<li>Deployment, </li>
</ol>
Due to the sturcture of the course and time constraints, maintence was not full covered and there was less emphasis
on the testing and deployment phases.
