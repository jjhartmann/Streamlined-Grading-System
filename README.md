Streamlined-Grading-System
==========================

Term project for CMPT 275 at Simon Fraser University

This project consist of implementing a mock grading system for some school ABC. 
There where multiple requirments for the project, and it was structured in such a way as to 
replicate a real world software engineering enviroment. 

For the entire semester ~3 Months, we were placed in groups of 8 and had to work together to accomplish 
a prototype of the proposed project. 

Team members:
Patrick Wan,  phwan@sfu.ca
XuShun Qiu,  xsq@sfu.ca
Demet Dilekci, ddilekci@sfu.ca
Jeremy Hartmann, jhartman@sfu.ca
Asante Nyamekye, anyameky@sfu.ca
zihan chen, czihan@sfu.ca
Lekabari Nghana, lnghana@sfu.ca
Kwan Yui Wong, kyw6@sfu.ca


As a team we went through all phases of software development, from: 
(1) requirment acquisition and planning, 
(2) design and planning
(3) Implementation and coding
(4) Testing 
(5) Deployment
Due to the sturcture of the course and time constraints, maintence was not full covered and there was less emphasis
on the testing and deployment phases.
